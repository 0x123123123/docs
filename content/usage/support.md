# Support

Please use [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) for language specific questions. The Stackoverflow community will be able to answer questions unique to your programming language and technology stack that the Drone maintainers are unqualified to answer.

For all other questions please use the community [chat room](https://gitter.im/drone/drone) or [mailing list](https://discuss.drone.io) for support. When asking for help please provide adequate information for debugging. Please read our [guidelines](https://discuss.drone.io/t/how-to-ask-for-help/188) for asking for help.

# Issues

Please reserve the GitHub issue tracker for confirmed issues. In the past we have received a large number of questions and false positive issues which reduce the effectiveness of the issue tracker. If you have a question or think you have found a bug please discuss in the community [chat room](https://gitter.im/drone/drone) before opening an issue.

# Security

Please notify the project maintainers privately to discuss security concerns or disclose potential vulnerabilities. Please direct message [bradrydzewski](https://gitter.im/bradrydzewski) with questions or concerns.

Please note this is an open source project and is not corporate sponsored or venture backed. We do not have the financial means to offer rewards for confirmed vulnerabilities. If any of our corporate users are interested in funding a rewards program please get in touch.
