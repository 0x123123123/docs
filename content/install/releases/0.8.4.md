# Keep Alive

You can now configure grpc keepalive by setting the below environment variables. This can be helpful if you have a reverse proxy or load balancer sitting between your agent and servers that is timing out requests.

```
DRONE_KEEPALIVE_TIME=6m
DRONE_KEEPALIVE_TIMEOUT=30s
```

Please note that you must also increase your laod balancer or reverse proxy timeout to a value greater than the `DRONE_KEEPALIVE_TIME + DRONE_KEEPALIVE_TIMEOUT` duration. 

Please also note that the `DRONE_KEEPALIVE_TIME` must have a duration greater than than 5 minutes. A duration of 5 minutes or lower will result in connection errors.
