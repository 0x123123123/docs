* Error collapsing pipeline steps in the user interface. See [#102](https://github.com/drone/drone-ui/issues/102).
* Error rendering build matrix and build logs. See next section of this document.

# Data Upgrades

Please note that some data cannot be automatically migrated to the new database structure. As a result, build matrix and build logs created by previous versions of Drone are not properly rendered and result in javascript errors and infinite loading messages.

# Agent Upgrades

Please note that the agent <> server communication protocol changed from `stomp` to `jsonrpc`. You should therefore upgrade all agents to match your server version.
