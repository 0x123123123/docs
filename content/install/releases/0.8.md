This is the second release candidate for version 0.8. This is a breaking release, however, there are no end-user breaking changes.

# Breaking Changes

# Upgrade Instructions

This section details configuration changes when upgrading. The first configuration change is the agent and server are split into separate images:

```diff
services:
  drone-agent:
-   image: drone/drone:0.7
+   image: drone/agent:0.8
```

The sever requires the DRONE_HOST environment variable and will exit when not properly configured. This setting is used to generate commit status links and lets encrypt certificates, and in the future will be used to more accurately perform oauth2 redirects.

```diff
services:
  drone-server:
    image: drone/drone:0.8
    environment:
+     - DRONE_HOST=http://drone.mycompany.com
```

The agent server protocol is using grpc and listening on port 9000. Please update your server configuration to expose the grpc port.

```diff
services:
  drone-server:
    image: drone/drone:0.8
    ports:
      - 80:8000
+     - 9000:9000
```

The agent server protocol requires an update to your agent configuration. Please replace the ws address with the server hostname (including port).

```diff
services:
  drone-agent:
    image: drone/agent:0.8
    environment:
-    - DRONE_SERVER=ws://drone-server:8000/ws/broker
+    - DRONE_SERVER=drone-server:9000
```

Please note that grpc uses http/2 and cannot be routed through a reverse proxy (i.e. nginx). If you are using nginx you must bypass and connect the agent directly with the server.

# User Interface Changes

Previous version of drone used react-mdl which was deprecated and required significant work to replace. I took this opportunity to re-evaluate the front-end stack and decided to promote an experimental polymer branch.

# Browser Compatibility

Polymer and webcomponents are a bleeding edge technology and I expect to encounter some compatibility issues and minor regressions. Please help us to stabilize the user interface and send patches to [github.com/drone/drone-ui](https://github.com/drone/drone-ui).

Please note that Drone supports evergreen browsers. This is a developer tool and we expect developers to keep their browsers up-to-date. The user interface will not be ported to legacy browser versions.

Browser | Version | Status
--------|---------|--------
Chrome  | 59      | Fully supported
Firefox | 54      | Fully supported; performance issues due to polyfills
Safari  | 10      | Fully supported
Edge    | 11      | Not Tested [1]

[1] Please note that [@bradrydzewski](https://github.com/bradrydzewski) does not have an instance of the Microsoft Edge to test and resolve issues. Please consider sending a patch to help us support all major browser vendors.

# Repository Syncing

Previous versions of drone synchronized repository and permission data in-memory and used sql hacks to provide the intersection of the in-memory and sql datasets. This approach had known performance limitations.

This release synchronizes the repository list to the database. This is now possible thanks to universal support of the `INSERT IGNORE` and `INSERT REPLACE` statements. The sql hacks are replaced with standard joins.

This new approach could result in repository permissions taking longer to propagate to drone. The user interface will also need to be improved to correctly handle data post-synchronization.

# What's Next

Future releases will continue to focus on reaching the 1.0 milestone and [compatibility promise](https://golang.org/doc/go1compat). There are currently less than 15 issues remaining before we can tag our first 1.0 release candidate. We expect subsequent minor releases following 1.0 (1.1, 1.2, etc) will focus on stabilizing and cleaning up the codebase, and removing technical debt.
