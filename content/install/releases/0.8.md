This is the first release candidate for version 0.8. This is a breaking release, however, there are no end-user breaking changes.

# Breaking Changes

* Switch the agent server protocol to grpc. See [#2065](https://github.com/drone/drone/issues/2065).
* Separate server and agent binaries and images. See [#2052](https://github.com/drone/drone/issues/2052).

# Closed Issues

* Ability to recover agents on network failure. See [#2065](https://github.com/drone/drone/issues/2065).
* Ability to reactive a repository in the UI. See [#523](https://github.com/drone/drone/issues/523).
* Ability to globally limit container resources. See [#1681](https://github.com/drone/drone/issues/1681).
* Always use the standard json logging driver. [#1523](https://github.com/drone/drone/issues/1523)
* Separate server and agent binaries and images. See [#2052](https://github.com/drone/drone/issues/2052).
* Sync repository and permissions in the database. See [#2036](https://github.com/drone/drone/issues/2036).
* Validate username when adding a user. See [#1418](https://github.com/drone/drone/issues/1418).

# Closed UI Issues

* Scroll to top when switching pages. See [#48](https://github.com/drone/drone-ui/issues/48).
* Hamburger icon not visible on small screens. See [#27](https://github.com/drone/drone-ui/issues/27).
* Remove CDN dependency. [#32](https://github.com/drone/drone-ui/issues/32).
* Show token popup does not work in Firefox. [#112](https://github.com/drone/drone-ui/issues/112).
* Replace deprecated react-mdl library. [#113](https://github.com/drone/drone-ui/issues/113).

# Upgrade Instructions

This section details configuration changes when upgrading. The first configuration change is the agent and server are split into separate images:

```diff
services:
  drone-agent:
-   image: drone/drone:latest
+   image: drone/agent:latest
```

The agent server protocol is using grpc and listening on port 9000. Please update your server configuration to expose the grpc port.

```diff
services:
  drone-server:
    image: drone/drone:latest
    ports:
      - 80:8000
+     - 9000:9000
```

The agent server protocol requires an update to your agent configuration. Please replace the ws address with the server hostname (including port).

```diff
services:
  drone-agent:
    image: drone/agent:latest
    environment:
-    - DRONE_SERVER=ws://drone-server:8000/ws/broker
+    - DRONE_SERVER=drone-server:9000
```

Please note that grpc uses http/2 and cannot be routed through a reverse proxy (i.e. nginx). If you are using nginx you must bypass and connect the agent directly with the server.

# User Interface Changes

Previous version of drone used react-mdl which was deprecated which required significant work to replace. I therefore decided to re-evaluate the front-end stack and decided to promote an experimental polymer branch.

Polymer and webcomponents are a bleeding edge technology and I expect to encounter some compatibility issues and minor regressions. Please help us to stabilize the user interface and send patches to [github.com/drone/drone-ui](https://github.com/drone/drone-ui).

# Repository Syncing

Previous versions of drone synchronized repository and permission data in-memory and used sql hacks to provide the intersection of the in-memory and sql datasets. This approach had known performance limitations.

This release synchronizes the repository list to the database. This is now possible thanks to universal support of the `INSERT IGNORE` and `INSERT REPLACE` statements. The sql hacks are replaced with standard joins.

This new approach could result in repository permissions taking longer to propagate to drone. The user interface will also need to be improved to correctly handle data post-synchronization.

# What's Next

Future releases will continue to focus on reaching the 1.0 milestone and [compatibility promise](https://golang.org/doc/go1compat). There are currently less than 15 issues remaining before we can tag our first 1.0 release candidate. We expect subsequent minor releases following 1.0 (1.1, 1.2, etc) will focus on stabilizing and cleaning up the codebase, and removing technical debt.
